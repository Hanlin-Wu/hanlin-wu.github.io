hanlin.wu@link.cuhk.edu.hk

I am a PhD candidate in the [Language Processing Lab](https://cuhklpl.github.io/index.html) at the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to joining the lab, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have a Research Master's degree in Basic Psychology at Renmin University of China (2020), and a B.A. in Translation and Interpreting at Beijing International Studies University (2017).

I'm interested in how the human brain represents and processes linguistic and social information. My PhD thesis looks at how the demographic information of the speaker influences spoken language comprehension. Meanwhile, I am doing projects related to how social-emotional information and linguistic information are processed in the brains of children with and without Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In most of my work, I use methods of EEG and fMRI.

**3 November 2023.** [AMLaP Asia 2023](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/amlap.asia/) was successfully concluded! This was the first international acedemic conference that I co-organised. I was so happy that many attendees enjoyed the three-day conference as well as the pre-conference workshop.
