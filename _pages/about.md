**About Me**

hanlin.wu@link.cuhk.edu.hk

Hi, I am a PhD student in the Language Processing Lab at the Department of Linguistics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to joining the lab, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have a research Master's degree in Psychology at Renmin University of China, and a B.A. in translation and interpreting at Beijing International Studies University.

I'm interested in how the human brain represents and processes language. I'm currently working on projects related to the speaker effects in speech comprehension, and in word form learning. Recently, I started to look at whether large language models represent and process language in the way that human brains do. In most of my work, I use electrophysiological methods such as EEG, but I'm also interested in neuroimaging methods such as fMRI and fNIRS.
